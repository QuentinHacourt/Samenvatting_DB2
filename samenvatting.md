# Databanken 2: Samenvatting

Een samenvatting van het vak Databanken 2 geschreven door Quentin Hacourt.

Hallo, ik ben Quentin Hacourt en ik schrijf deze samenvatting met als doel om minstens 16/20 te halen op het vak Databanken 2 (bertels BTFO).

## Week 1: herhaling TDM/DB1

### Syntax

```SQL
    SELECT
    FROM
    WHERE
    GROUP BY
    HAVING
    ORDER BY
```

### OoE

```SQL
    FROM
    WHERE
    GROUP BY
    HAVING
    SELECT
    ORDER BY
```

### Joins

- Inner Join
    - Implicit (! Join condition in WHERE)
    - Explicit, Join condition
        - ON
        - USING
- OUTER JOIN
    - RIGHT
    - LEFT
    - FULL

### "Exotic joins"

- NATURAL
- CROSS
- LATERAL

### Combining output

- Q1 UNION [ALL] Q2
    - appends the result of Q2 to the result of Q1, no duplicates allowed, unless "all" is used
- Q1 INTERSECT [ALL] Q2
    - returns all rows that are both in the result of Q1 and in the result of Q2. Duplicate rows are eliminated unless INTERSECT ALL is used
- Q1 EXCEPT [ALL] Q2
    - returns all rows that are in the result of Q1 but not in the result of Q2. Duplicates are eliminated unless EXCEPT ALL is used

## Week 2: oefeningen

Geen theorie

## Week 3: CTEs

### What are CTEs?

Common Table Expressions

### Use?

- A temporary table ~ view
- To lighten complicated queries by defining auxiliary tables
- ~ subqueries but tightened in a looser way to the main query
- To parse recursive tables in a recursive way

Keyword to be used: WITH

### When?

- With SELECT, DELETE, UPDATE, INSERT main queries
- Can be by itself a SELECT, DELETE, UPDATE or INSERT auxiliary table

### Example:

update fines by 10% of all competition players that have never been in the board:

```SQL
WITH comp_spelers AS (
SELECT spelersnr, naam, voornaam
FROM spelers
WHERE bondsnr IS NOT NULL
), non_bestuur AS (
SELECT *
FROM bestuursleden b RIGHT OUTER JOIN spelers s
ON (b.spelersnr = s.spelersnr)
WHERE b.spelersnr IS NULL
)
UPDATE boetes
SET bedrag = bedrag * 1.1
FROM comp_spelers c INNER JOIN non_bestuur n ON (c.spelersnr = n.spelersnr)
WHERE c.spelersnr = b.spelersnr
```

### Recursive Example:


```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE lijst (naam, zoon, nr) AS (
SELECT naam, zoon, 0
FROM kings
WHERE naam = 'Louis V'
UNION ALL
SELECT naam, zoon, nr + 1
FROM lijst L INNER JOIN kings K
ON (L.naam = K.zoon)
WHERE nr < 5
)
SELECT naam
FROM lijst;
```

## Week 4: Optimalisations

### Algorithmic / Understanding

- Location of subqueries
    - Preferably
        - In FROM
        - Uncorrelated
    - Avoid
        - In SELECT
        - In WHERE
        - Correlated to SELECT, WHERE,... (Correlated to FROM is not that bad)
- Order of "tables" when JOINING
    - Start with those having the smallest *footprint*
        - Tables with few records
        - Subqueries delivering few records
    - End with the largest tables/subqueries returning the largest amount of records

### Indexes

**What?**

Indexes help to reduce computational time:
- Records are stored in =/= files
- Each file exists of =/= pages
- If one needs a record:
    1. The right page is selected using hash algorithms
    2. The right record is extracted from that page

**How?**

Indexes can be searched by using two methods:

- Sequential: row by row
    - Which completely defeats the point of having an index in the first place lmao don't do this
- indexed
    - Tree structure
    - 2 ways:
        - Search records based on their values
        - Parse a table using a sorted, auxiliary column

**Different algo's**

- B-tree (default)
- Hash
- GiST
- SP-Gist
- GIN
- BRIN

**Index Types**

- CREATE INDEX spelers_postcode_idx ON spelers (postcode
asc);
- CREATE UNIQUE INDEX spelers_naam_vl_idx ON spelers (naam, voorletters);
- CREATE INDEX spelers_naam_vl_partial_idx ON spelers (naam, voorletters) WHERE spelersnr < 100;
- REINDEX INDEX een_index;
REINDEX TABLE een_tabel;
REINDEX DATABASE een_database;

**Index Commands**

- CREATE
- ALTER
- DROP

**Indexes: Not Only Pros**

- Cons
    - Every write to an indexed table requires index adaptations
    - One table can have multiple indexes (multi-col or multiple single-col)
    - Index itself needs (physical space as well)
- Column choice:
    - Unique index on candidate keys
    - Index on (combinations of) cols being used in comparisons, selections
    - Index on (combinations of) cols being used in ORDER BY

**Different kinds of indexes:**

- Multi-table:
    - Index on cols across tables
- virtual:
    - Index on expression
- Selective:
    - Index on part of table
- Hash:
    - Index based on page-address
- Bitmap:
    - Interesting when a lot of redundant data exists

### Operators

- Operators to avoid:
    - OR
    - AND
    - UNION
    - Expressions with indexed cols
    - LIKE if pattern starts with _ or %
    - no smart joins (use redundant conditions in a join to force SQL into a certain processing order)
    - HAVING
    - Too many cols in SELECT clause
    - DISTINCT
    - not using keywords ALL option with SET operators like UNION (ALL does shorten the execution time)
    - DATATYPE conversions
    - ANY & ALL operators
        - use min/max instead if possible

### Tools

- EXPLAIN
    - Shows execution plan of statement
- EXPLAIN ANALYZE
    - Carry out the command and show the actual run times

## Week 5: Security, Embedded en Views

### Security

**Different layers:**

- Hardware:
    - Secured server
    - Redundant Hardware
    - Backups
- Software:
    - Update platform
    - DBMS
        - Roles
        - Users
        - Stored Procedures
        - ...

**SQL Injection: Solutions**

- Remove Escape characters from input
- Data type check
- Prepared statements
- Stored Procedures

***BUT***

- Combinations of above can be necessary$
- Easier to restrict to desired input, than check for input to refuse

### Views

**What?**

- Table, based on other table(s)
    - Part of existing table
    - Output of (complex) query
- Content varies according to underlying tables
    - Update of base tables => update of view
    - Update of view does not imply update of base tables ...
- Content of view is given/calculated when SELECT view is issued

**Views - Syntax example:**


```SQL
CREATE VIEW leeftijden (spelersnr, leeftijd) AS
    SELECT spelersnr, 2008 â€“ year(geb_datum)
    FROM spelers
;
```

**Views - Main Properties**

- Security wise: access to view, not to raw material
- Requires no storage space
- Allows to simplify complex queries that need to be executed a lot
- Views cannot always be mutated
- In case of reorganisation of database:
    - A view can let old applications still be usable although base database structura has been altered

### Embedded

**Embedded: SQL is pre-compiled**

= SQL within a programming language, eg PhP:


```PhP
<?php
$dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=publisher") or die("Could not
connect");
if (!pg_connection_busy($dbconn)) {
pg_send_query($dbconn, "select * from authors;");
}
$res = pg_get_result($dbconn);
echo "Call to pg_get_result(): $res\n";
?>
```

## Week 6: Stored Procedures, Functions, Triggers

### Stored Procedures - Functions

Both are a set of SQL and procedural statements

- Set of SQL and procedural statements:
    - Declarations
    - Assignments
    - Loops
    - Flow control
    - ...
- Stored on DBMS
- Created using "CREATE FUNCTION" syntax
- Overloading is possible (different input params, same name)

Differences:

|                                 | Stored Procedure | Function                  |
|---------------------------------|-----------------:|---------------------------|
| Use in an expression            | x                | yes                       |
| Return a value                  | x                | Yes                       |
| Return values as OUT parameters | Yes              | x                         |
| Return a single result set      | Yes              | Yes (as a table function) |
| Return multiple result sets     | Yes              | x                         |

So in most cases, the purpose of a stored procedure is to:

- Perform actions without returning any result (INSERT, UPDATE operations i.e.)
- Return one or more scalar values as OUT parameters
- Return one or more result sets

Usualy the purpose of a user-defined function is to process the input parameters and return a new value.

**PostgreSQL: 4 kinds of functions**

- Query language functions
- Procedural language functions (functions written in, for example, PL/pgSQL or PL/Tcl)
- Internal functions
- C-language functions

**Example of function in PL/pgSQL**

```SQL
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION increment(i INT) RETURNS INT AS $$
BEGIN
RETURN i + 1;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
-- An example how to use the function:
SELECT increment(10);
```

**Example of stored proc in PL/pgSQL**


```SQL
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION add_city(city VARCHAR(70), state CHAR(2))
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
INSERT INTO cities VALUES (city, state);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
-- An example how to use the function:
SELECT add_city('St.Louis', 'MO');
```

**Another example with multiple output params**

```SQL
CREATE FUNCTION dup(in int, out f1 int, out f2 text)
AS $$ SELECT $1, CAST($1 AS text) || ' is text' $$
LANGUAGE SQL;
SELECT * FROM dup(42);
```

**Same example with TABLE function**

```SQL
CREATE FUNCTION dup(int) RETURNS TABLE(f1 int, f2 text)
AS $$ SELECT $1, CAST($1 AS text) || ' is text' $$
LANGUAGE SQL;
SELECT * FROM dup(42);
```

### Triggers

**What?**

A trigger is associated with specified table, view or foreign table and will execute the specified *function_name* when certain events occur.

Can fire:

- before operation is attempted on a row
- after the operation is completed
- instead of the operation

If the trigger fires before or instead of the event, the trigger can skip the operation for the current row or change the row being inserted (for INSERT and UPDATE operations only).

A trigger that is marked FOR EACH ROW is called once for every row that the operation modifies.

Also, a trigger definition can specify a boolean WHEN condition, which will be tested to see whether the trigger should be fired.

In row-level triggers the WHEN condition can examine the old and/or new values of columns of the row.

Statement level triggers can also have WHEN conditions, although the feature is not so useful for them since the condition cannot refer to any values in the table.

**Two types of triggers**

- FOR EACH ROW
- FOR EACH STATEMENT

This specifies whether the trigger procedure should be fired once for every row affected by the trigger event, or just once per SQL statement.

If neither is specified, FOR EACH STATEMENT is default.

Constraint triggers can only be specified FOR EACH ROW

**Trigger examples:**


```SQL
CREATE TRIGGER check_update
BEFORE UPDATE ON accounts
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE check_account_update();

CREATE TRIGGER check_update
BEFORE UPDATE OF balance ON accounts
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE check_account_update();

CREATE TRIGGER check_update
BEFORE UPDATE ON accounts
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (OLD.balance IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.balance)
EXECUTE PROCEDURE check_account_update();

CREATE TRIGGER log_update
AFTER UPDATE ON accounts
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (OLD.* IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.*)
EXECUTE PROCEDURE log_account_update();
```

## Week 7: RDBMS-ORDBMS-OODBMS

TODO: this flippin' chapter

## Week 8: Exotische datatypes

### XML

eXtensible Markup Language (cringe)

XML is de meest cringe en vergezochte manier om data voor te stellen, JSON or GTFO.

### JSON

JSON is een veel minder cringe manier om data voor te stellen, in tegenstelling tot XML is json vlot om te schrijven en te lezen voor mensen.

**Samenvatting**: gebruik gewoon json, de 90's zijn over boomers

### Other Formats

Even more exotic:

- Geometric types
- Network address types
- Text search types
- Composite types
- Range types

-> RDBMS reach out towards application domains with heavy database use

## Week 9: import/export

### When

- To load data into your DBMS
- IoT: To automatically stream data to your database
    - Conversion
    - Parsing
    - Scripts
    - Security ! Consistency !
- Backup/Archive
    - "Online/offline" storage
    - To keep RDBMS at speed
    - Offline readability <> readability by original application
- Exchange to other programs
    - RDBMS <> RDBMS:
        - use SQL
        - Direct links
    - RDBMS > Applications
        - XML
        - JSON
        - CSV
        - ...
    - Applications > RDBMS
        - Limited (relationships)

### Export

Possibilities/points of attention

- Copy/paste through pgadmin into Excel (<- cringe microsoft software)
- Backup functionality
- Character sets
- ...

### Import

Possibilities

- CSV
- SQL
- XML
- JSON
- ...


```SQL

```
